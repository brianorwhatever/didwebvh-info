# Trust DID Web - Information

This is the information site/repository for the **Trust DID Web (`did:tdw`) DID Method**.

`did:tdw` information is published at [https://didtdw.org](https://didtdw.org)

The `did:tdw` specification is published at [https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb](https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb)

## Contributing

Contributions to this information site are welcome! Feel free to improve the
content found here about the DID Method:

- talk about what you have done with `did:tdw`,
- share information about the `did:tdw` software you have written,
- tell us about the services you offer in deploying `did:tdw`, or
- anything else you can think of about `did:tdw`.

The `did:tdw` information site is a [MkDocs Material] site generated from the
Markdown files in the site's [GitHub repository].

[GitHub Repository]: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb-info

Contributions can be mode via pull requests (PRs) to the GitHub repository that will
be reviewed and (if relevant) merged. You can use the GitHub website itself to add or
edit files, or fork the repo and edit them in your favorite GitHub-friendly
editor.  Each commit of a PR must have a DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin -
[https://github.com/apps/dco](https://github.com/apps/dco)) sign-off -- handled
automagically on the GitHub website or, if done from the command line, by adding
the `-s` (lower case) option on the `git commit` command (e.g., `git commit -s
-m "Comment about the commit"`).

If you are running locally and want to test your changes before creating your
pull request, you must install and run `mkdocs`. Guidance for that can be found in the
[MkDocs Material] documentation. Once it is installed, run `mkdocs` from the
root folder and open your browser to the indicated site.
