# Trust DID Web (did:tdw) Registries/Resolvers

Proof of concept implementations of `did:tdw` software for DID Controllers and resolvers can be found here:

- [Typescript](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb-ts)
- [Python](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb-py)
- [Go](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/trustdidweb-go)

The implementations support most of the features of the core `did:tdw` including
key pre-rotation. The [TypeScript](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb-ts) implementation has an experimental
implementation of the witnesses feature.
