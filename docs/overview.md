The emergence of [Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
(DIDs) and with them the evolution of [DID
Methods](https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/w3c/decentralized-identifier/did-methods/)
continues to be a dynamic area of development in the quest for trusted, secure
and private digital identity management where the users are in control of their
own data.

The [`did:web` method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) provides a solution that is recognized 
for its simplicity of deployment and its cost-effectiveness, allowing for easy establishment of a 
credential ecosystem. It leverages the Domain Name System (DNS) to perform the DID operations including 
DID-to-HTTPS transformation and allowing for DIDs to be associated with a domain's reputation or published 
on platforms such as GitHub. This approach is, however, not without its challenges. It is, for example, not 
inherently decentralized as it relies on DNS domain names, which require centralized registries. In addition 
`did:web` lacks a cryptographically verifiable, tamper-resistant, and persistently stored DID document,
including its verifiable history.

We propose the `did:webhv` (`did:web` + Verifiable History) method presented
here as an enhancement of `did:web`, providing a solution to address the
limitations inherent of `did:web`. The `did:webvh` was called `did:tdw` through
version v0.4 of the specification. `did:webvh` introduces features such as a
verifiable history, akin to what is available with ledger-based DIDs, but
without relying on a ledger, a self-certifying identifiers (SCIDs), and
authorized key(s) to increase control over the creation, update, and
deactivation of a DID. Furthermore, the `did:webvh` method provides a more
decentralized approach by ensuring that the security of the embedded SCID does
not depend on DNS, and enables resolving a cryptographically verifiable trust
registry and status lists, using DID-Linked Resources, which `did:web` lacks. 

In summary, the `did:webvh` method offers a higher level of assurance for those
requiring more robust verification processes compared to what is provided by
`did:web`. It also represents a significant stride towards a more trusted and
secure web, where the integrity of cryptographic key publishing and management
is paramount. In addition, `did:webvh` maintains backward compatibility with
`did:web` and the resulting DID can be published as both `did:web` and
`did:webvh`. These possibilities carter to a flexible and broader range of use
cases and corresponding trust requirements, addressing both those who are
comfortable with the existing `did:web` infrastructure to those seeking greater
security assurances provided by `did:webvh`. 

### A `tl;dr` summary of `did:webvh`

#### The `did:webvh` Structure *(or, Where is the `DID Doc`??)*

- `did:webvh` uses a so-called DID Log to publish cryptographic material and capabilities
- A `DID Log` is stored as `did.jsonl` file and represents a list of entries, each formatted as JSON line
- Every `DID Log Entry` describes a specific version of the corresponding DID via a JSON object
    - DID Log Entry := `{ "versionId": "", "versionTime": "", "parameters": {}, "state": {}, "proof" : [] }`  
        - `versionId` -- a value that combines the version number (starting at `1` and incremented by one per version), followed by a literal dash `-`, and a hash of the entry, which links each entry to its predecessor in a ledger-like chain
        - `versionTime` -- a string in UTC ISO8601 format 
        - `parameters` -- a set of parameters that impact the processing of the current and future log entries
            - method
            - SCID
            - updateKeys
            - portable (optional)
            - prerotation (optional)
            - nextKeyHashes (optional)
            - witnesses (optional)
            - deactivated (when accurate)
            - ttl (optional)
       - `state` -- the current version of the DIDDoc
       - `proof`-- a Data Integrity (DI) proof calculated across the entry, signed by a DID Controller authorized key to update the DIDDoc, and optionally, a set of witnesses that monitor the actions of the DID Controller

- The entire `DID Doc` is part of the "state" object *(in every JSON line of a DID Log Entry within the DID Log File)*

#### Creating the first DID Doc

1. Create a preliminary log entry
    - Create the JSON structure with the aforementioned properties and the following values:
        - `versionId` := the literal string "`{SCID}`"
        - `versionTime` := as asserted by the DID Controller, for example, `"2024-04-05T07:32:58Z"`
        - `parameters` := as needed and defined by the DID Controller, for example:
            - method := `did:webvh:0.4`
            - SCID := the literal string "`{SCID}`" (here and wherever the calculated SCID value will eventually be placed)
        - `state` := initial DID Doc with placeholders (the literal string "`{SCID}`") wherever the calculated SCID value will eventually be placed
        - *`proof` := not set at this point. Will be set in step 4 below*

2. Calculate the SCID
    - SCID := `base58btc(multihash(JCS(preliminary log entry with placeholders), <hash algorithm>))`
        - `JCS` := an implementation of the JSON Canonicalization Scheme ([RFC8785](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8785))
        - `multihash` := an implementation of the [multihash](https://multiformats.io/multihash/) specification
        - `<hash algorithm>` := one of the hash algorithms accepted by  `did:webvh` (see [parameters](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/#didwebvh-did-method-parameters) in the specification)
        - `base58btc` := an implementation of the [base58btc](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-msporny-base58-03) function

3. Update the preliminary log entry
    - Replace all placeholders (the literal string `{SCID}`) with the calculated SCID value.
    - Calculate the `entryHash` as `entryHash := base58btc(multihash(JCS(entry), <hash algorithm>))`.
    - Set the `versionId` to `1` (for version 1 of the DID), followed by a literal dash `-`, followed by the calculated `entryHash`.

4. Calculate the data integrity (DI) proof
    - `proof` := a proof calculated across the *entire* DID Log Entry and signed with an `updateKeys` (and optionally by witnesses). Values of required attributes include:
        - `type` := `DataIntegrityProof`
        - `cryptosuite` := `eddsa-jcs-2022`
        - `proofPurpose` := `assertionMethod`

5. Add the DI proof to the `proof` property of the DID Log Entry

#### Creating the first DID Log

- Turn the Log Entry into a JSON Line according the [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) specification and add the line to the DID Log File for publication

#### Some considerations

- When updating the DID to a new version:
    - The SCID is only calculated when creating the first DID Log Entry, and
      only used as the `versionId` when calculating the `entryHash` of that
      first entry.
    - For each a new log entry after the first, the `entryHash` is calculated
      with its `versionId` set to the `versionId` *of the prior log entry*. This
      results in all of the entries being cryptographically "chained" together
      such that an alteration to an entry is evident in all succeeding entries.
    - The `versionId` is the number of the version (incrementing by one per version), the literal `-`, followed by the calculated `entryHash` for the entry.
    - *Note*: Both the SCID and the `entryHash` are calculated *before* the DI
      proof calculation is added to the entry.
- `did:webvh` uses the same DID-to-HTTPS transformation as `did:web`, so
  `did:webvh`'s  `did.jsonl` (JSON Lines) file is found in the same location as
  `did:web`'s `did.json` file, and supports an easy transition from `did:web` to
  gain the added benefits of `did:webvh`.
- For backwards compatibility, and for verifiers that "trust" `did:web`, a
`did:webvh` can be trivially modified and published in parallel to a `did:web`
DID. For resolvers that want more assurance, `did:webvh` provides a way to "trust
did:web" (or to enable a "trusted web" if you say it fast) enabled by the
features listed in the [introduction](./README.md).
