content found here about the DID Method:

The `did:webvh` information site is a [MkDocs Material] site generated from the

Contributions can be mode via pull requests (PRs) to the GitHub repository that will
be reviewed and (if relevant) merged. You can use the GitHub website itself to add or
edit files, or fork the repo and edit them in your favorite GitHub-friendly
editor.  Each commit of a PR must have a DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin -
[https://github.com/apps/dco](https://github.com/apps/dco)) sign-off -- handled
automagically on the GitHub website or, if done from the command line, by adding
the `-s` (lower case) option on the `git commit` command (e.g., `git commit -s
-m "Comment about the commit"`).

If you are running locally and want to test your changes before creating your
pull request, you must install and run `mkdocs`. Guidance for that can be found in the
[MkDocs Material] documentation. Once it is installed, run `mkdocs` from the
root folder and open your browser to the indicated site.
